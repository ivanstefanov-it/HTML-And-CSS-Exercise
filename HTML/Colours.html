            A web page (<a href="#">webpage</a>) is a hypertext document provided by a website and displayed to a user in a web browser.[1] A website typically consists of many web pages linked together in a coherent fashion. The name "web page" is a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book.

            <h2>Elements</h2>
            <p>
                The core element of a web page is one or more text files written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).[2] Many web pages also make use of JavaScript code for dynamic behavior and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) code for presentation semantics.[2] WebAssembly executables can also be used for portions of web page behavior.[3] Images, videos, and other multimedia files are often embedded in web pages.

            <h2>Navigation</h2>
            <p>
                Each web page is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator (URL). When the user inputs a URL into their browser, that page's elements are downloaded from web servers. The browser then transforms all of the elements into an interactive visual representation on the user's device.[4]
                If the user clicks or taps a link to another page, the browser repeats this process to display the new page, which could be part of the current website or a different one. The browser has user interface features that indicate which page is displayed.
